Introduction
To show how to utilize a genetic algorithm to determine the best path. A population of rockets
tries to find a path to the target without crashing. The rockets' primary aim is to land in the desired
location without clashing with any impediments. We can see how the rockets change over time
and are able to make their way to their target place in a pretty short length of time. The Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization tool based on genetics and natural selection
principles. It's commonly used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems that
would take an eternity to solve otherwise. It's commonly utilized to tackle optimization issues, as
well as in research and machine learning[1]. In addition, The rockets will automatically learn how
to reach to the target spot. In other words, we produce a generation of rockets that travel randomly
using that genetic process.
